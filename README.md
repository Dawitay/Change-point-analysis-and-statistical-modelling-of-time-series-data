## ðŸ“ˆ Brent Oil Price Change Point Detection â€“ Project Summary

This notebook explores **structural shifts in Brent oil prices** by applying both **frequentist** and **Bayesian change point detection** techniques. The goal is to identify periods of significant change in either the **price level** or **volatility**, and to interpret those shifts in the context of real-world events.

### ðŸ§ª Key Components

#### âœ… 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

* Brent oil price data is cleaned and missing values are interpolated.
* Log returns are computed to capture changes in volatility.

#### âœ… 2. **Frequentist Change Point Detection**

* Uses the `ruptures` library with the PELT algorithm to detect abrupt shifts in **mean price**.
* Change points are plotted over time to visualize potential structural breaks.

#### âœ… 3. **Bayesian Change Point Detection (PyMC)**

* Applies a probabilistic model using PyMC to detect shifts in **volatility**.
* Models the log returns and estimates the most probable change point (`Ï„`) using MCMC sampling.
* Posterior plots help identify the most likely time of volatility regime change.

#### âœ… 4. **Interpretation and Conceptual Analysis**

* Results from both models are interpreted with a focus on **economic or geopolitical events** that may explain the shifts.
* The notebook prepares the ground for associating these shifts with real-world events from an external `Events.csv` file (to be merged in future work).
